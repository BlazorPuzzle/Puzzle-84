## The Challenge

This is a .NET 9 Blazor Web App with global server interactivity.

In Puzzle 83, we implemented breadcrumbs as a navigation feature.

Our initial solution showed adding some navigation elements and event handlers to every page.
How can we wrap this into a component and abstract away that feature?
